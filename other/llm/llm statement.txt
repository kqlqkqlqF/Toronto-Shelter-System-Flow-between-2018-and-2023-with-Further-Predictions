Me: 
can you rewrite these words in a scientific report tone? but remember not be too scientific, since these words were provided by a university student, not a 50 year old man.
The data analysis was conducted using R [@citeR], a versatile statistical programming language. We utilized a range of packages to enhance our analysis. The tidyverse [@tidy] suite of packages provided a comprehensive toolkit for efficient data manipulation and visualization. Specifically, ggplot2 [@gg2] allowed us to create compelling visualizations, while dplyr [@dplyr] facilitated data manipulation tasks such as filtering and summarizing. For data reading, we relied on the readr [@readr] package for its speed and user-friendly interface. The here [@here] package simplified file management within our project directory structure. Additionally, kableExtra [@kable] was employed to generate visually appealing and customizable tables, enhancing the presentation of our findings. For Bayesian analysis, we utilized the rstanarm [@rstanarm] package, which provided an elegant interface to Stan, a cutting-edge platform for statistical modeling and computation. This allowed us to estimate relationships within our data using a Bayesian framework, providing valuable insights into our research questions. Report generation was seamlessly managed using knitr [@knitr], enabling the integration of R code within our document.  Other essential packages included tibble [@tibble], stringr [@stringr], lubridate [@lubridate], janitor [@janitor], and testthat [@testthat], each contributing to various aspects of our data analysis process, from data manipulation to quality assurance.
